## Overview

### The challenge

Build out an IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the reference design as possible. IP Address locations use the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). The map uses [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
